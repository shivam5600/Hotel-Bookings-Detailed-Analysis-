# Hotel Bookings Analysis and Cancellation Predictor
March-April 2021
I imported the data-set that has 1 lakh+ booking records of various Hotels and Resorts, then did
Descriptive and Diagnostic Analysis with the help of EDA.
I created the Booking Cancellation Predictor ML model by using Random Forest, Xgboost, and got avg
score of 0.99 on the train and test data.
Finally, I made a PPT that have all my findings, insights, and suggestions presented in it.
